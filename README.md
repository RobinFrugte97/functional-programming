# Functional programming

The goal of this course is to use d3 to clean data and make a dynamic representation (data visualisarion); data is functionally transformed to a visualisation of museum objects from [NMVW](http://collectie.wereldculturen.nl/).


# Prints

My concept is about prints. The museum has a lot of different prints from all over the world. I liked the idea of plotting the prints on a map. Most prints originate from Japan so I decided to focus specificly on Japan. I want to use the coordinates of each print to plot them on a map of Japan.
